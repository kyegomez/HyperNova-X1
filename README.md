# HyperNova-X1
First ever AI-designed rocket engine for long distance solar travel.


## HyperNova-X1 V1
To design the optimal rocket engine specification focusing on maximum efficiency, lowest weight-to-thrust ratio, and ease of design/manufacturing, we will explore the following areas:

1. **Type of Engine**: A **full-flow staged combustion engine** is the most efficient type of rocket engine currently in use. It maximizes fuel and oxidizer use while reducing engine wear. This design is used by the most advanced rockets, such as SpaceX's Raptor engines.

2. **Fuel and Oxidizer**: 
   - **Fuel**: **Liquid Methane (CH₄)**. Methane is an excellent choice for multiple reasons: it provides high specific impulse, it's cleaner than kerosene, and its cryogenic properties are easier to handle than liquid hydrogen. Additionally, methane can be synthesized from CO₂, offering potential for in-situ resource utilization on missions to Mars.
   - **Oxidizer**: **Liquid Oxygen (LOX)**. LOX is commonly used because it’s readily available, has high oxidizing properties, and pairs well with liquid methane.

3. **Combustion Cycle**: **Full-Flow Staged Combustion (FFSC)** ensures maximum efficiency by utilizing both fuel-rich and oxidizer-rich preburners, feeding fully expanded gas into the combustion chamber. This approach minimizes engine wear and increases thrust-to-weight ratios by eliminating cavitation and optimizing combustion.

4. **Material Selection**: The materials used in engine components should focus on high strength-to-weight ratios, thermal resistance, and ease of fabrication:
   - **Combustion Chamber and Nozzle**: **Niobium alloys (e.g., C103)**. This material has high melting points and excellent thermal conductivity, enabling it to withstand high-temperature combustion and transfer heat efficiently. Its high-temperature resistance makes it suitable for liquid methane and LOX combustion.
   - **Turbopumps**: **Titanium alloys** (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V) for high-strength, low-density parts in the turbopumps. Titanium provides excellent corrosion resistance and can endure extreme pressure in rocket engine environments.
   - **Injector Plate**: **Inconel (Inconel 718)**. Inconel is a nickel-based superalloy that performs well under high stress and temperatures, making it ideal for injector plates where combustion rates are highest.

5. **Engine Cooling**: **Regenerative Cooling** should be used, where the cryogenic liquid methane is routed through channels in the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle, absorbing heat before entering the combustion chamber. This maximizes engine efficiency by pre-heating the fuel while maintaining structural integrity.

6. **Nozzle Design**: **Aerospike Nozzle** or **Bell Nozzle (optimized with expansion-deflection)**. Aerospike nozzles provide high efficiency across a range of altitudes, whereas bell nozzles with proper expansion-deflection can be easier to manufacture and still provide efficient performance.

7. **Additive Manufacturing**: Use **3D printing** (additive manufacturing) techniques for rapid production and simplified geometry. Complex components like injector plates and regenerative cooling channels can be integrated into a single piece using **Selective Laser Melting (SLM)** techniques, reducing part counts and increasing reliability.

### Engine Specification:
- **Thrust**: 250,000 lbf (or tailored based on use case, adjustable for larger payloads).
- **Thrust-to-weight ratio**: Aim for **>120:1** using light materials like titanium and niobium alloys.
- **Chamber pressure**: 300 bar (approximately 30 MPa) for maximum efficiency.
- **Specific impulse**: ~380 seconds (vacuum) using Liquid Methane/LOX.
- **Weight**: Approx. **1.5-2 tons** depending on final component designs and materials.

### Summary of Key Features:
1. **Engine Cycle**: Full-flow staged combustion for maximum efficiency.
2. **Fuel/Oxidizer**: Methane (CH₄) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX).
3. **Materials**: Niobium alloys for combustion chambers/nozzles, titanium alloys for turbopumps, Inconel for injector plates.
4. **Cooling**: Regenerative cooling to optimize efficiency and thermal management.
5. **Manufacturing**: Additive manufacturing (3D printing) for component integration and rapid production.

### Conclusion:
This rocket engine design combines high performance and efficiency with simplicity in manufacturing. Leveraging full-flow staged combustion, methane-LOX fuel, and advanced materials, it ensures high thrust-to-weight ratio while maintaining durability. The use of additive manufacturing further enhances its ease of production and reliability.
